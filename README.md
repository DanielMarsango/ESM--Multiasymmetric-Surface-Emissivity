# ESM--Multiasymmetric-Surface-Emissivity
The Multiasymmetric Surface Emissivity Model represents the emission from an accretion disk including multiple asymmetric components, such as spiral arms or hot spots. It reproduces complex double-peaked line profiles by combining localized emissivity distortions on a base radial distribution.
