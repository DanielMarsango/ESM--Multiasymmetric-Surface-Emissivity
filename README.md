# ESM--Multiasymmetric Surface Emissivity

The Multiasymmetric Surface Emissivity Model describes the emission distribution over the surface of an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole, allowing for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple asymmetric patterns. Unlike traditional axisymmetric parameterizations, this model incorporates localized or distorted emissivity components, representing spiral arms, heated regions, gravitational perturbations, or preferential accretion zones.

The total emissivity is expressed as the weighted sum of several overlapping asymmetric structures superimposed on the base radial emissivity profile of the disk. Each component is characterized by its own contrast, phase, angular width, and radial dependence, enabling the reproduction of complex variations in the shape and intensity of double-peaked emission lines observed in relativistic disk-like AGNs.

This formalism provides a more realistic representation of the diskâ€™s dynamical and geometrical conditions, allowing the investigation of multiple regions with different degrees of distortion and asymmetry, associated with phenomena such as instabilities, tidal interactions, or non-stationary accretion events.
